# Fast DSP Approximations

This is a compilation of open-srouce algorithms for fast approximations of expensive calculations, useful for DSP applications.

Most of these examples are in either Rust or C, but they can be adapted to other languages as well.

Feel free to open a PR for any additions you would like to add!
